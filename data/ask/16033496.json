I&#x27;m currently making over $380k in a very well funded startup and live remote in a no income state. I&#x27;m in my 20s and everyday, I wake up, work, play games, look at my investments and sleep. I&#x27;m pretty introverted and read a ton of books on investments and don&#x27;t go out much. I&#x27;m not an unsocial person per se, but I&#x27;m in a small town and it&#x27;s hard to make friends here. I thought about moving back to Bay Area but the 12% income tax and $2k rents goes against every frugality principal I was brought up in (I currently pay $500 for rent and 0% state income tax).<p>Having said that, this lifestyle has been taking a huge toll on me. I won&#x27;t say I&#x27;m depressed, but I&#x27;m becoming so disillusioned with life. I&#x27;ve so much goddam wealth that literally everything comes easy. I&#x27;ve travel oversea frequently in a hope to feel alive - and for a short time I do. Drugs, women, crazy adventures. Then I come back to this small town and it seems like there&#x27;s nothing to strive for. I have everything I want in life. Nothing is a challenge anymore.  The other day I randomly bought a house for $45k in cash so I can rent it out, but i kinda lost motivation after the first week<p>Anyone feel like that? I feel completely directionless. I tried going to meetups and everything but I can&#x27;t connect with anyone because our interests are so different.","time":1514601531,"title":"Ask HN: I made a ridiculous amount of money and feel “depressed”","type":"story"}
