{"by":"gkya","descendants":0,"id":16051102,"score":2,"text":"With my graduation imminent, I&#x27;m trying to pick a study area and a topic for my masters, and Digital Humanities seem to be an interesting area where I can combine my knowledge of programming and my scholarly aspirations in the field of humanities.  Not really knowing much about the field (I&#x27;ve recently known about it), I&#x27;ve been collecting reading for the past couple of weeks to be read after my final exams this week, and I thought maybe I could get some information from people with actual field experience here in HN.  I&#x27;d appreciate anything from personal experience&#x2F;views to pointers to actual research output in the field.  Thanks in advance!<p>(BTW research papers might be in Italian, French and Turkish too, which are languages other than English I can read.)","time":1514889403,"title":"Ask HN: Digital Humanists here?
