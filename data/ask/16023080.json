I am now in a senior position but lately I feel like nothing new is happening and every challenge is the same old one with a different title. I am starting to rethink my path as a developer. Thinking I need to get into new fields of coding I have started coding blockchain and AI, at first it was magic, nothing like any code I ever knew but now 6 month later its starting to smell the same and I know in a few month it will get old. \nI am a person who always needs new and interesting challenges and I feel like the software industry can no longer provide me with them, of course, there will always be new challenges but I feel they are all of the same type. \nHow do you keep the drive after so long? \nalternatively what job in the tech industry or out of the tech industry could you recommend where every day is fight or flight, a battle for survival where if I fall asleep on my watch I will lose?<p>Thanks","time":1514479157,"title":"How do you keep the drive after years of development?","type":"story"}
