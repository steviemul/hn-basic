Any user can register any vehicle number to receive alerts for that number. The App is country specific hence eliminating the likely hood of a message sent to a US car ending up been delivered to a Norwegian Driver.\nMessages that can be sent are predefined and Car related. Some predefined messages allows sending of additional text of up to 32 characters, this behavior is intended for sending of Parking Tickets to cars, and Tickets for traffic offence.\nYou can try out the App, CarTact, by searching for it on the Google Play Store or using this link
