{"by":"nanzhong","id":16025046,"score":1,"text":"Solving our own pain point, we are automating insurance shopping for American consumers. After a quick signup, a consumer&#x27;s insurance shopping and management are put on autopilot with us. Better deals automatically come to them for the rest of their lives. Switching takes only a single tap. It will save consumers time and money while giving them better protection.<p>Bugs in our system could mess up people&#x27;s lives big time. If you take pride in writing code that &quot;just works&quot;, if you love turning an idea into a deployed feature in minutes, you&#x27;ll love it here. Practical experience with Python&#x2F;Django, SQL and automated testing strongly preferred. Practical experience with Ruby&#x2F;Rails or Java will be considered too.<p>Please contact jobs@safebutler.com. We are a 4-person team based in Newark CA (across the bay from Facebook HQ). The company is backed by a group of angels, including YouTube co-founder.  At this point, Bay Area candidates with US citizenship or greencard only please.","time":1514496676,"title":"SafeButler (YC S17) is hiring employee #3 to modernize insurance","type":"job"}
