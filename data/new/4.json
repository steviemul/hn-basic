I am curious if there are people around here familiar with the content strategy Document, don&#x27;t create - especially for starting companies. In short, it is a way to get you to make content that is simply documenting your processes, milestones, etc in the process of building the company, instead of thinking of creative ways or topics to become an authority on. It has been quite  a good strategy for my company, but it has its challenges, especially when it comes to the &quot;polished&quot; factor of the content.<p>Would love to hear the thoughts of people who have been documenting the journey of building their companies and maybe even get a few tips on how to improve. My company is here: https:&#x2F;&#x2F;weardulo.com so feedback is appreciated if you have experience with it. Thanks!
