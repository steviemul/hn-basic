I have over a 100 accounts I need to keep track of and access typically access at a whim.<p>Since it&#x27;s insecure to both use the same password over and over or to modify a single password per service (e.g. appending &quot;fb&quot; or &quot;tw&quot; etc to a password when using a different service) I have found that a password manager is literally the only thing working for me.<p>However, as break-ins become more and more frequent, I am concerned that my single point of failure, my password manager, could become compromised. I mean it seems almost inevitable, right? An attacker wouldn&#x27;t even need to compromise the service or app you&#x27;re using but your phone instead to gather the same data.<p>So I&#x27;m curious to those of you who use something other than a typically password manager: what do you use and has it been successful or a pain?","time":1514874799,"title":"Ask HN: Does anyone use an alternative to a password manager?","type":"story"}
