But I would imagine there are people who would like that level of degree.<p>I also realize that a bachelors level degree has a number of requirements that aren\u2019t purely comp sci requirements. I don\u2019t see that as a problem. Why not have a full curriculum? I think that is possible.<p>Also, why does a comp sci degree have to cost so much? In fact, if you\u2019re willing to put in the effort to learn and grow why can\u2019t it be free? This may be a very US centric view. I know other countries have different ways of paying for college educations. But here in the US it\u2019s going to cost you tens of thousands of dollars at minimum. Does it have to be that way?<p>So I guess my question is, why can\u2019t there be a free or low cost, not for profit, accredited bachelors level computer science degree?<p>What am I missing?","time":1514771785,"title":"Ask HN: Is there room for a non-profit computer science degree provider?","type":"story"},{"by":"Ivoah","descendants":5,"id":16041664,"kids":[16044332,16043484,16044393,16043398],"score":54,"time":1514743019,"title":"Reverse Engineering \u201cStar Wars: Yoda Stories\u201d (2014)","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/www.zachtronics.com\/yoda-stories\/"},{"by":"signa11","descendants":36,"id":16045073,"kids":[16045558,16045504,16047190,16047072,16045583,16047790,16047672,16047568,16045517],"score":102,"time":1514790416,"title":"Spotting Field Sabotage in Meetings (2011)","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/whatsthepont.com\/2011\/06\/19\/spotting-field-sabotage\/"},{"by":"smacktoward","descendants":71,"id":16041992,"kids":[16043231,16053803,16043590,16043564,16043848,16044105,16046998,16044258,16044394,16043217,16043268,16043214,16043938],"score":60,"time":1514746223,"title":"The 3DO: The birth of my cynicism","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.gamasutra.com\/blogs\/KeithBurgun\/20171218\/311849\/The_3DO_The_birth_of_my_cynicism.php"},{"by":"enkiv2","descendants":2,"id":16041921,"kids":[16043859,16043883],"score":18,"time":1514745375,"title":"My hypermedia history","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/@enkiv2\/my-hypermedia-history-11d576ce6dbb"},{"by":"infosecrf","descendants":25,"id":16034790,"kids":[16037673,16039760,16038424,16040407,16038091,16038286],"score":93,"time":1514632889,"title":"Bluetooth Low Energy WarDriving 101","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.davidsopas.com\/ble-driving-101\/"},{"by":"AlexeyBrin","descendants":115,"id":16021541,"kids":[16024902,16022336,16021942,16021686,16023571,16023207,16022609,16022827,16022006,16021771,16023459,16021760,16024474,16021790],"score":181,"time":1514461520,"title":"C++17 constexpr everything, or as much as the compiler can","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/solarianprogrammer.com\/2017\/12\/27\/cpp-17-constexpr-everything-as-much-as-the-compiler-can\/"},{"by":"bhattisatish","descendants":21,"id":16021876,"kids":[16022741,16024063,16022166,16023350],"score":214,"time":1514467773,"title":"Building a Distributed Log from Scratch: Data Replication","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/bravenewgeek.com\/building-a-distributed-log-from-scratch-part-2-data-replication\/"}],"pagingInfo":{"pageNum":10,"pages":17,"url":"\/api\/top\/10"}}
