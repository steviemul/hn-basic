I&#x27;m a primary school teacher but I taught myself to code many years ago - I bought a palm pilot in 2000 and started writing little shareware apps for it. I&#x27;ve been building side projects (mostly websites) ever since.  I&#x27;d love to work full-time as a web developer.<p>I&#x27;m proficient in rails and php. I&#x27;m also learning js and vue . Over the years I&#x27;ve applied for several (remote) positions but I never get to the interview stage.  From a quick scan of my inbox, it&#x27;s mostly because I lack professional experience (8 companies). 2 companies turned me down due to lack of open source contributions (although I shared some code from side projects) and 1 company asked me to do a coding test but then turned me down because they didn&#x27;t like my solution (it was a simple string manipulation and I wrote a simple method - they&#x27;d have preferred it if I wrote a new String class). There are also many companies I&#x27;ve applied to who never bothered to write back.  All the roles I&#x27;ve applied for have been junior level.<p>Does anyone have any concrete, actionable advice that I can take to improve my chances of getting interviewed and hopefully hired?<p>Thanks in advance","time":1514752324,"title":"Ask HN: Help me get out of teaching and into software","type":"story"}
