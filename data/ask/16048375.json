It’s now 2018 and I’ve spent months trying to come up with good side business&#x2F;product ideas and have hit an analysis paralysis point with no good ideas. I’d like to focus on small business problems but just can’t seem to find any.  I’ve emailed businesses, scoured the web and am having little luck. My last product was a hypothesis that never gained traction so I’m now extra cautious (maybe too much) about jumping into any new unvalidated ideas.<p>Any entrepreneurial advice on how to get out of this funk? And also any advice&#x2F;approaches on how to identify a good idea?","time":1514845400,"title":"Ask HN: It’s 2018, what to build now?","type":"story"}
