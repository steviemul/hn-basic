This seems different from the use cases most LMS&#x2F;courseware was designed for.<p>Does anyone know any that have any of these features? (I know there&#x27;s probably nothing that has all this)<p>1. Interface for students to formally submit deliverables (as opposed to just another forum)<p>2. Forum where students can post questions and join discussion<p>3. Ability to differentiate between students taking the class statically (can start whenever, no feedback) vs on a schedule (with others, with instructor feedback)<p>4. I can livestream sessions<p>5. Students can comment on live sessions using text chat<p>6. Students can speak questions in live sessions using microphone<p>7. Students can screenshare to the group in a live session<p>8. Tutoring mode: instructor can control mouse and keyboard of a student temporarily, or work in a shared environment during session<p>9. Automatic transcription of recorded and live sessions (ideally human edited, but voice recognition alone is ok)<p>10. Ability to form discussion sections by grouping students into subsets, in an organic way (MIT Open Courseware does this great)<p>11. Provides ability to use streamlined signup (like, just provide an email address) if I prefer, instead of charging money (useful from promos and teasing upcoming courses)","time":1514936946,"title":"Ask HN: Any online courseware with these features?","type":"story"},{"by":"wheresvic1","descendants":0,"id":16057026,"score":1,"time":1514936795,"title":"Upgrading ubuntu to 17.10 from 17.04","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/smalldata.tech\/blog\/2018\/01\/03\/upgrading-ubuntu-to-17.10-from-17.04"},{"by":"eplanit","descendants":0,"id":16057021,"score":2,"time":1514936724,"title":"Diabetes drug 'significantly reverses memory loss' in mice with Alzheimer's","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.eurekalert.org\/pub_releases\/2017-12\/lu-dd122017.php"},{"by":"jatoben","descendants":3,"id":16056972,"kids":[16057605],"score":21,"time":1514936240,"title":"iMac Pro Teardown","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.ifixit.com\/Teardown\/iMac+Pro+Teardown\/101807"},{"by":"osivertsson","descendants":0,"id":16056931,"score":8,"time":1514935905,"title":"PostgreSQL: Fix for intel hardware bug will lead to performance regressions","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/message-id\/20180102222354.qikjmf7dvnjgbkxe%40alap3.anarazel.de"},{"by":"xref","descendants":0,"id":16056910,"score":4,"time":1514935735,"title":"May the next Etsy learn its lessons","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/m.signalvnoise.com\/may-the-next-etsy-learn-its-lessons-af9928218114"},{"by":"kirillzubovsky","descendants":0,"id":16056909,"score":3,"time":1514935724,"title":"Amazon\u2019s blended-reality mirror revealed","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.geekwire.com\/2018\/amazon-patents-blended-reality-mirror-shows-wearing-virtual-clothes-virtual-locales\/"},{"by":"zeristor","descendants":1,"id":16056905,"kids":[16056934],"score":1,"time":1514935690,"title":"AI early diagnosis could save heart and cancer patients","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/news\/health-42357257"},{"by":"cetico","descendants":0,"id":16056880,"score":1,"time":1514935518,"title":"Building a fast track for software development teams","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/pulse\/building-fast-track-software-development-teams-yves-junqueira\/"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":0,"id":16056839,"score":2,"time":1514935189,"title":"'Quantum radio' may aid communications and mapping","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/phys.org\/news\/2018-01-quantum-radio-aid-indoors-underground.html"},{"by":"ramzyo","descendants":0,"id":16056830,"score":2,"time":1514935130,"title":"We Aren\u2019t Destroying the Earth","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2017\/12\/29\/books\/review\/inheritors-of-the-earth-chris-thomas.html"},{"by":"dnetesn","descendants":0,"id":16056819,"score":1,"time":1514935066,"title":"Traffic Ghost Hunting","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/nautil.us\/issue\/16\/nothingness\/traffic-ghost-hunting-2"},{"by":"snake117","descendants":1,"id":16056818,"kids":[16057222],"score":2,"time":1514935055,"title":"Iran blocks encrypted messaging apps amid nationwide protests","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.theverge.com\/2018\/1\/2\/16841292\/iran-telegram-block-encryption-protest-google-signal"},{"by":"yangshun","descendants":0,"id":16056796,"score":1,"time":1514934827,"title":"Mention Bot \u2013 Automatically mention potential reviewers on pull requests","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/github.com\/facebook\/mention-bot"},{"by":"georgeglue1","descendants":1,"id":16056793,"kids":[16056957],"score":4,"text":"Every year, I usually see some talks bubble up onto the frontpage or some recaps posted, but I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ve seen anything yet.<p>What are your favorites&#x2F;highlights from this year?\nhttps:&#x2F;&#x2F;media.ccc.de&#x2F;c&#x2F;34c3","time":1514934806,"title":"Ask HN: What were your favorite CCC talks this year?","type":"story"},{"by":"microtherion","descendants":0,"id":16056791,"score":3,"time":1514934787,"title":"Elon Musk: \u201cIn ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land\u201d (2016)","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/twitter.com\/elonmusk\/status\/686279251293777920"},{"by":"brudgers","descendants":0,"id":16056789,"score":1,"time":1514934770,"title":"Capitol Records, Inc.
