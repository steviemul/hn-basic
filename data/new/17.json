I could receive messages from my friends with iPhones but not reliably from anyone else.  I realize this sort of scenario will become less common but just curious about why this is still a problem?  I&#x27;m surprised to see WiFi calling beat messaging here (I&#x27;ve seen WiFi calling as an option on both Android and iPhones for a while now).","time":1514920113,"title":"Ask HN: It's 2018 \u2013 why aren't all text messages delivered over the internet?","type":"story"},{"by":"knoxa2511","descendants":0,"id":16054433,"score":1,"time":1514920074,"title":"Fishing for Hackers 2 \u2013 Kubernetes Boogaloo","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/sysdig.com\/blog\/fishing-hackers-2-kubernetes-boogaloo\/"},{"by":"prostoalex","descendants":0,"id":16054431,"score":2,"time":1514920072,"title":"Wholesale Pot Prices Plummet","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/www.eastbayexpress.com\/oakland\/wholesale-pot-prices-plummet\/Content?oid=11999163"},{"by":"antonis427","descendants":0,"id":16054415,"score":2,"time":1514919957,"title":"5 Amazing Android Apps for Android Developers and Designers","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/hackernoon.com\/5-amazing-android-apps-for-android-developers-designers-4678b8d231b4"},{"by":"kokster","descendants":0,"id":16054382,"score":3,"time":1514919755,"title":"How to think about running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes \u2013 a detail oriented view","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/medium.com\/kokster\/postgresql-on-kubernetes-the-right-way-part-one-d174ee8a56e3"},{"by":"sethbannon","descendants":0,"id":16054336,"score":3,"time":1514919457,"title":"Ethereum Foundation Q4 Roundup","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/blog.ethereum.org\/2018\/01\/02\/q4-roundup\/"},{"by":"stevekemp","descendants":0,"id":16054322,"score":2,"time":1514919407,"title":"Using ePaper with an ESP8266 device","type":"story","url":"https:\/\/steve.fi\/Hardware\/d1-epaper\/"},{"by":"hamstercat","descendants":0,"id":16054303,"score":2,"time":1514919315,"title":"How Often Should You Ship?","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/thecodist.com\/article\/how_often_should_you_ship"},{"by":"Tomte","descendants":0,"id":16054293,"score":2,"time":1514919270,"title":"Debate on Censorship: The Myth of Artistic Freedom","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/www.zeit.de\/kultur\/2017-12\/debate-censorship-artistic-freedom-sexism-metropolitan-museum-balthus"},{"by":"KeepTalking","descendants":0,"id":16054291,"score":1,"time":1514919267,"title":"Academic publishing while female [pdf]","type":"story","url":"http:\/\/calwomenofecon.weebly.com\/uploads\/9\/6\/1\/0\/96100906\/publishing_female.pdf"}],"pagingInfo":{"pageNum":17,"pages":17,"url":"\/api\/new\/17"}}
